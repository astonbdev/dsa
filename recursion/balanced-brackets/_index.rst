Balanced Brackets (Recursively)
-------------------------------

Solve the Balanced Brackets challenge from Stacks and Queues to
use recursion, rather than a stack. Here's the original challenge:

  Write a function that is passed a string which can contain any text,
  including different kinds of brackets: ``{} [] ()``.

  It should examine the string and decide if the string is "balanced" ---
  a balanced string is one where the different kinds of brackets are
  properly balanced, such that you never close an bracket that isn't
  opened, is out of order, or end up with unclosed brackets.
